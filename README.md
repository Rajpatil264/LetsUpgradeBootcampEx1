# Number Classification and Number Swapping

This repository contains two C++ programs that demonstrate fundamental concepts in programming: number classification as even or odd, and number swapping without using a third variable.

## Table of Contents

1. [Number Classification](#number-classification)
2. [Number Swapping](#number-swapping)

## Number Classification
**Filename:** `even_odd_check.cpp`

### Introduction
This program checks whether a given number is even or odd. It is a simple demonstration of conditional statements in C++.

### How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter an integer when prompted.
4. The program will display whether the entered number is even or odd.

## Number Swapping
**Filename:** `number_swapping.cpp`

### Introduction
This program swaps the values of two numbers without using a third variable. It employs the XOR operation for the swapping, showcasing a creative approach to exchanging values.

### How to Use
1. Compile the program using a C++ compiler.
2. Run the executable.
3. Enter two integers when prompted.
4. The program will swap the values of the two numbers using XOR operations and display the swapped values.
